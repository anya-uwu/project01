[Live site](https://as-project1.netlify.app/)

The goal of this project was to convert the provided PSD files into a multi-page website that is fully functional and compliant with accessibility guidelines.
Later I was tasked with updating the site and adding some Javascript functionality. I decided to make the comment section of the blog page functional. The user can enter their name, email and a comment to the form and their commment will be displayed to the screen with their name. The form has error handling to prevent invalid form submissions.
